# Strain Diary
Lightweight tool for tracking and organizing one's experiences with various strains of cannabis
<br/><br/>
Project started Dec 6 2018, to scratch an itch. Trying to keep this as simple as possible.<br/><br/>

- REST API in Go + MySQL 8<br/>
- Decoupled web front end in boring HTML + [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) + a few small libraries<br/>
- UI prioritizes mobile experience first, desktop later
